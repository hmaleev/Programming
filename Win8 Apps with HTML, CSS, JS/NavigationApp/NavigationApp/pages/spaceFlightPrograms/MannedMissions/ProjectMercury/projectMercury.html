                Project Mercury started in 1958 as NASA's inheritance of the U.S. Air Force's Man In Space Soonest program objective to 
                make the first single-astronaut flights into Earth orbit. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates 
                from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first
                 American in space aboard Freedom 7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight.
                 John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962 aboard 
                Friendship 7. Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in
                 L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.

                The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with Mercury in what was called the Space Race, with its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok. 
                They bested the U.S. in getting humans into space soonest, by launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single Earth
                 orbit aboard in Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight. In August 1962, they achieved an almost
                 four-day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent Vostok 4 mission 
                carrying Pavel Popovich. The Soviet lead, perceived by the U.S public as most acute in May 1962, motivated President
                 John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress to commit to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which 
                effectively launched the Apollo program.
