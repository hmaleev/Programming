                The NASA XS-1 (Bell X-1) was followed by additional experimental vehicles, including the X-15 in cooperation with the US Air Force and
                 US Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized
                 control systems. When the spacerace began the main objective was to get a person into space as soon as possible,
                 therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. This led to the choice of a 
                small capsule spacecraft while rocket plane proposals like a modified X-15 were turned down. Instead X-15 was used for
                 development of techniques and equipment of value for the space missions. This included jets for changing the
                 orientation of a spacecraft, space suits for astronauts and horizon definition for navigation. Nearly 200 flights were
                 made between 1959 and 1968 allowing NASA to collect data vital not only to the spacerace but also the design of the
                 Space Shuttle. The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km).
