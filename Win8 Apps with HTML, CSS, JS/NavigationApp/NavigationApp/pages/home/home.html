            <p>    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the agency of the United States government that is 
                responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research.

                President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 with a distinctly civilian
                (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and
                 Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for
                 Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.

                Since that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, 
                the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station
                 and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is
                 also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown
                 management for unmanned NASA launches. Most recently, NASA announced a new Space Launch System that it said would take
                 the agency's astronauts farther into space than ever before and provide the cornerstone for future human space 
                exploration efforts by the U.S.

                NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts
                 of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with 
                advanced robotic missions such as New Horizons, and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the 
                Great Observatories and associated programs. NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such
                 as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.
